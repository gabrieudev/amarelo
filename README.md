## Features

- Email sending for user registration confirmation.
- Pagination-enabled searches.
- Documentation with Swagger-enabled endpoints.
- User login with JWT authentication.
- Role-based authorization for controlling access to different API endpoints.
- Passwords encrypted using industry best practices.
- Integration with MySQL database.

## Technologies

- ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-17-orange): Programming language.
- ![Spring Boot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring%20Boot-3-green): Framework for building applications.
- ![Spring Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring%20Security-6-green): Security framework for Spring applications.
- ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-Database-blue): Relational database.

## Configuration

- Before starting the application, update the `application.properties` file with all necessary information.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gabrieudev/amarelo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <path>`
3. Navigate to the docker directory: `cd docker`
4. Run the docker-compose file to create and start the MySQL container: `docker compose up`
5. Return to the initial directory: `cd <path>`
6. Build the project: `./mvnw clean install` (for Windows: `mvnw.cmd clean install`)
7. Run the application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (for Windows: `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`)

## Usage

1. Upon starting the project, an administrator user with predefined roles is automatically inserted into the database using `AdminDataLoader.java`. You can modify their information either there or in `application.properties`.
2. Use an administrator role user to access protected endpoints.
